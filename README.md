# Antivirus-Repo
This isn't meant to be a compiled program. Rather, it's just a sandbox repo that I used to develop some Anti-virus algorithms. Mainly a WuManber algorithm used for pattern matching files in search of virus signatures. Actual program code was used for was developed in a controlled environment and has since been destroyed.
